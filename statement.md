Project Overview: Movie Recommender 

This document summarizes the core aspects of the Simple Content-Based Movie Recommendation System .
Aspect-
    1.Movie Recommendation System (CLI) :
         Problem Statement - Consumers experience "choice paralysis" and spend excessive time browsing streaming libraries, often defaulting to previously watched 
         content. The gap in this instance is the need for a targeted filter that reduces friction.
    2.Scope of the Project :
         The project will be focused solely on implementing the Content-Based Filtering logic, using static in-memory genre data and calculating the similarity scores.
         Excluded from the scope of this project include consuming external APIs, persistent storage, user profiles or other graphical interface.
    3.Target Users :
         Target users for the movie recommendation system are students and developers who are learning about recommendation algorithms, specifically for simple 
         and easily traceable implementations useful for students, or demonstrative implementations in front of guests, etc.
    4.High-Level Features :
         1. Genre Similarity Scoring: Ranks movies based on genre overlap. 
         2. CLI Interface: Simple input/output via the command line. 
         3. Basic Error Handling: Notifies the user if a movie is not found.
